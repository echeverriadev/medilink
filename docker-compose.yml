    # Environment variables are baked into the build for Vite, but can be passed for runtime if needed differently.
    # Note: Vite env vars (VITE_*) are replaced at build time, so for a truly dynamic image,
    # one might need a runtime script to inject env vars into window object, 
    # but for this standard setup, baking them in via .env file at build time is standard for simple setups.
